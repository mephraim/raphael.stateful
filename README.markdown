# Raphael Stateful Plugin
This is a plugin for the [Raphael JavaScript library](http://raphaeljs.com/)
that adds simple state machine-like functionality to Raphael elements and sets. 

# Using the plugin
Including the stateful plugin on your page will automatically enable the plugin
as long as the plugin source file is included after Raphael source file.

# More documentation?
I am currently developing this plugin for another project, so it is in semi-active
development. Take a look at the code, the demo html, and the spec file for
examples of how to use the plugin. 

Iâ€™ll slowly be adding more documentation as things solidify a little more.
